    Project 82: Online Movie Ticket Booking Portal 
Real-world Context: 
Cinemas require real-time booking systems for seat management and revenue tracking. 
Detailed Problem Description: 
Develop a system that: 
•	Displays available movies, shows, and timings. 
•	Allows booking, cancellation, and seat availability checking. 
•	Uses 2D arrays for seat layouts, structures for movie data, and loops for interaction. 
•	Calculates ticket cost and taxes through functions. 
•	Uses file handling to store booking data and pointers for dynamic customer list. 
Course Outcomes Covered: 
CO1: Design algorithm for booking and seating logic. 
CO2: Implement loops/decision control for seat validation. 
CO3: Use arrays/functions for modularization. 
CO4: Apply pointers for dynamic booking records. 
CO5: Design modular ticket booking application. 
Syllabus Topics Applied: Problem Solving, Arrays, Loops, Decision Control, Functions, Structures, Pointers, Dynamic Memory, File Handling.
